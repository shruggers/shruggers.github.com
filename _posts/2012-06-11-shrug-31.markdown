This month's ShRUG talk is from [Tom Crayford](https://github.com/tcrayford).


"Well designed Rails controller methods follow very similar execution paths. [Raptor](https://github.com/garybernhardt/raptor) is an experimental web framework designed to explode the Rails controller, reconstructing it inside the router.

This talk is a dive into Raptor's design, eventual goals and a small demonstration of what Raptor looks like today."


Tickets for the event are available on our [EventBrite page](http://sheffieldruby1206.eventbrite.co.uk/). Someone will be around from 18.45 if
you're around and we'll probably head out for a drink afterwards.
