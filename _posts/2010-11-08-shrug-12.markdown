[Jon Rowe](http://twitter.com/JonRowe) will be giving a talk called High in Fiber, about [Ruby Fibers](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9/classes/Fiber.html), and how to apply them in asynchronous code.

## Venue

We're at the GIST Lab as usual. Someone will be around from no later than 6.30pm. The main session will run 7pm-9pm. The GIST Lab is on Grinder's Hill, at one end of the Workstation.

If you're going, please sign up for a ticket here: [http://shrug12.eventbrite.com/](http://shrug12.eventbrite.com/) (If you want to just turn up, that's fine. We just like to know who's coming to help us get ready.)
