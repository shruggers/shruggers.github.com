It's that time of the year again. Time to put the talks and workshops to
one side for a month and get together for ShRUG's annual Christmas meal.

This year we're going to [Ginseng Korean
Restaurant](http://www.ginsengsheffield.co.uk/) for 7pm.

We'll be booking a table, so be sure to let us know that you're coming
so we have confirmed numbers by responding on the Google+ Page or
[dropping us an email](mailto:shrug@jamesalmond.com) or [Tweet
us](http://twitter.com/sheffieldruby).
