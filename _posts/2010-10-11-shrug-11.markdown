Ian White will be talking about [Pickle](http://github.com/ianwhite/pickle), his library for easy model creation in [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/).

We'll also have a quick retrospective of the thing that was a bit like a Code Retreat held the previous Saturday.

## Venue

We're at the GIST Lab again. Someone will be around from no later than 6.30pm. The main session will run 7pm-9pm. The GIST Lab is on Grinder's Hill, at one end of the Workstation.

If you're going, please sign up for a ticket here: [http://shrug11.eventbrite.com/](http://shrug11.eventbrite.com/) (If you want to just turn up, that's fine. We just like to know who's coming to help us get ready.)
