This monthâ€™s ShRUG talk is from [Jon Rowe](http://jonrowe.co.uk/):

"I'm passionate about TDD. I hate slow tests. I write app's that work
with Rails. I used to think these three things, (tests,speed,rails) was
a classic 'pick any two problem', now I don't.

Let's talk about building Rails apps; how we can use hexagonal
techniques to create code that is loosley coupled, isolated, and
hopefully better designed; how we can use the existing Rails ecosystem
to achieve this, and hopefully present a few ideas on where we can take
this."

Tickets are available on our [EventBrite page](http://bit.ly/shfruby1211), please sign up if you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.45 if you're around and we'll probably head out for a drink afterwards.
