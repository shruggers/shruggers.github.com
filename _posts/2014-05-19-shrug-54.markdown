## This month's meeting is a week later than usual

This month a number of the ShRUGgers will be heading up to Crief for the
[Scottish Ruby Conference](http://2014.scottishrubyconference.com/) on
the usual ShRUG slot so we're pushing it back a week.

This month's meeting will be a retrospective of the conference, with
some of the attendees looking back and presenting the key points from
the talks and sessions from the event. Hopefully this will give everyone
a chance to catch up on what they missed, both if they were there and if
they weren't!


If you are going to the conference it would be great if you can pick
something to present or discus for the meeting.

With the help of [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.org.uk/) weâ€™re at the [Enterprise Zone](http://enterprise.shef.ac.uk/about-us) this month.

Join our [Google+
event](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/c21kctmqssljgfq2gm8tkutufqo) to let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.15 if you're around and we'll probably head out for a drink in [The Red
Deer](http://www.red-deer-sheffield.co.uk/) afterwards.
