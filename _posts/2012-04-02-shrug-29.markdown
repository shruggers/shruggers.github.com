NOTE: CHANGED DATE!

ShRUG's scheduled date for April (Monday 9th) is a bank holiday, so we've
had to move the date this month. As such, we've organised a social on
Monday 2nd April. We'll be back to normal with a speaker/workshop in May.

We're meeting in the Rutland Arms at 7pm for food, something to drink,
some Ruby/Rails chat and a good catch-up. See you there!

If you want to say hello before then you can catch us on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/sheffieldruby) or on the [Google
Group](http://groups.google.com/group/shrug-members). Or, drop us
an [email](mailto:hello@shrug.org) if you'll need help finding us
on Monday. Hope to see you there!
