It's christmas and ShRUG's 2nd(!) birthday so we're organising a meal to
celebrate.

Please, [pick up a ticket](http://bit.ly/shrug1112) so I can book a
table.

James will be around on West Street beforehand if anyone fancies a
drink. Let us know!


If you want to say hello before then you can catch us on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/sheffieldruby) or on the [Google
Group](http://groups.google.com/group/shrug-members). Or, drop us
an [email](mailto:shrug@jamesalmond.com) if you'll need help finding us
on Monday. Hope to see you there!
