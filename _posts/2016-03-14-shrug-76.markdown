### Rubot Wars

In this workshop we will be building simple Ruby bots. With a dash of WebSockets (courtesy of the ActionCable in the new Rails 5) and with the kindness of tech-demo gods, we will then battle it out on the big screen!

We will start the workshop with a bot writing tutorial. Bots will be very simple, if you can ```bundle install``` - you can write a bot. Followed by a few rounds of battles. And finally we will wrap the workshop up with a brief description of how the server works and any questions you may have.

You will need your laptop with Ruby installed (any recent version should work), we will supply the client code for you closer to time.

#### About our speakers

Valentin is your local Ruby developer. He describes himself as half-man and half-machine he was first noted by historians in 1337 BC, for using "neh neh neh neh neh" as a rhetorical device. Although currently leading the FBI's most wanted list (not really :)), he is continuing his services as a humble writer of code under the brand Made Special - Epic Web Development.
