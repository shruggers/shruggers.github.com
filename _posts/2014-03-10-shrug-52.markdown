This month, we thought that we could pay tribute to Jim Weirich by watching some of his best talks as well as sharing some of our stories from meeting him. The session might go down the route of talking about open source as Jim was a hero when it came to this.

We have set up a poll for you to choose which talks you would like to watch. Please cast your vote here: \[Jim Weirich Talk Selection\](http://bit.ly/jim_weirich_talk_selection) and we will be showing the most popular ones.

With the help of \[epiGenesys\](http://www.epigenesys.org.uk/) we’re at the \[Enterprise Zone\](http://enterprise.shef.ac.uk/about-us) this month.

Join our \[Google+
event\](https://plus.google.com/events/c6bk13hohb2d2sdbip1lvf03om4) to let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.15 if you’re around and we’ll probably head out to raise a glass for Jim and his legacy in \[The Red
Deer\](http://www.red-deer-sheffield.co.uk/).
