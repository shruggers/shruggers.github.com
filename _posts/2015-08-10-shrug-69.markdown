### ShRUG in the pub

It's August, it's sunny(-ish), it's holiday time (hopefully!) so ShRUG is going on vacation for a month. Don't worry - we'll be back again in time for next month.

If you can't wait until next month, we'll be in the Red Deer from 6.30pm for drinks, food and a chat about what folk have been getting up. We'd love to hear if you've been up anything particularly techie in your spare time.
