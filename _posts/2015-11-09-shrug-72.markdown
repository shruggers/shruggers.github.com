### Video editing for Mac Rubyists using MovingImages

Learn how to write Ruby scripts for video editing, image editing and video content creation using MovingImages by Zukini.

Kevin will introduce the core concepts of how MovingImages works and then via some example scripts bring those concepts to life and create new videos.

After that we will have a workshop where you can write your own scripts using MovingImages.

#### Prerequisites

Please bring a Mac running OS X Yosemite or higher.

If you watch [this video series](http://zukini.eu/getting-started-with-scripting-movingimages-in-ruby/) beforehand, you'll have MovingImages installed and a heads up on some of the material that will be covered before the session.

#### About our speakers

Kevin Meaney ([@CocoaKevin](http://twitter.com/CocoaKevin)) is the developer of MovingImages and the director of [Zukini Software](http://zukini.eu/). He has been programming the Mac for far too long from C to Swift and fitted in C++, Carbon, AppleScript, Objective-C, and Cocoa along the way.

#### About our venue

Our meetup tonight will take place in our new venue, [Union St](http://www.union-st.org).

After tonight's meetup, we'll be heading to the [Rutland Arms](http://www.therutlandarmssheffield.co.uk/) for drinks, food and chat.
