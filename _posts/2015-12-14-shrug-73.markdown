### Sheffield Ruby Christmas Meal

As is tradition, we will be having our Christmas meal this December.

Based on suggestions from our [#sheffieldruby Slack channel](https://sheffielddigital.slack.com/messages/sheffieldruby) and our subsequent [poll](http://www.meetup.com/sheffieldrubyists/polls/1213554/) the #shruggers have decided that we will go to [Smoke](http://smokebbq.co.uk/) from 7pm.

We'll be booking a table, so be sure to let us know that you're coming so we have confirmed numbers by responding on the [Meetup
page](http://www.meetup.com/sheffieldrubyists/events/226944825/),
[dropping us an email](mailto:hello@shrug.org), [Tweet
us](http://twitter.com/sheffieldruby) or hit us up on our [#sheffieldruby Slack channel](https://sheffielddigital.slack.com/messages/sheffieldruby).
