As programmers, we can be pretty childish. We play with code, imagine new projects and solutions and sometimes we even pretend that we know something we don't yet know. 

In this talk, join me on a journey through the lessons of childhood. We'll revisit how to play nice, try our best and always tell the truth, but more importantly, we'll look at some of the things children don't have to learn, like how to see the world with fresh eyes. In an age when children are learning to be programmers, let's learn together how to be children, and how this can help us all to get better at what we do.

Please bring along a laptop with a recent(ish) version of Ruby as some audience participation may be required!
