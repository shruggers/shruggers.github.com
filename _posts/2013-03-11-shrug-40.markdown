This month we're holding a code battle. Write your player to solve a set problem and pit them against the other entrants. Pair up with someone else or work alone, the choice is yours! We'll reveal the problem on the night (and provide a base framework to write your player against) so you can't go researching strategies beforehand. In a similar way to a kata or dojo, hopefully this will be a good opportunity to test your Ruby skills in a way that you wouldn't on a day-to-day basis.

This will be a practical session so don't forget to bring a laptop with Ruby (1.9.3) installed, wireless and access to a GitHub (or equivalent) account.

With the help of [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.co.uk), we're at the
[Enterprise Zone](http://enterprise.shef.ac.uk/contact-us) this month.

Join our [Google+ event](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cjchvg5ork6qsf1l2pfckvdq9kk) to
let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.45 if you're around and we'll probably head out for a drink afterwards.
