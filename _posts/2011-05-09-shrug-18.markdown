In parallel with [LRUG](http://lrug.org), we'll be
playing Ruby Golf. Ruby Golf, similar to [Perl Golf](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PerlGolf) is "A game where one attempts to write the shortest \[..\] program to accomplish some goal."

We'll be working in groups to complete a series of 'holes' to pass a
pre-defined set of examples. At the end, the solutions will be scored,
discussed and a winning team will be announced.

This session is great for all levels of Ruby experience, with the
beginners getting the chance to work through some (reasonably) simple
examples and learn some language tricks and the more experienced
developers get to flex their Ruby fu.

Hopefully, we'll be pitching ourselves against the guys at [LRUG](http://lrug.org) and completing the same holes at the same time.
Special thanks to [Andrew McDonough](http://www.andrewmcdonough.com/) for helping us out with the examples.

So, bring your laptops and play along! We'll probably head out for [a beer](http://www.sheffieldtap.com/) afterwards.

If you're coming, please register for a ticket at our [Eventbrite
page](http://bit.ly/shrug18).
