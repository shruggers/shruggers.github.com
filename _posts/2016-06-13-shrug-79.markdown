As is tradition, we are having our summer social this month.

Based on suggestions from our [#sheffieldruby Slack channel](https://sheffielddigital.slack.com/messages/sheffieldruby) the #shruggers have decided that we will go to [The Shakespeare](http://www.shakespeares-sheffield.co.uk/) from 6pm. But the fun won't stop there, we are thinking of going for food at [The Riverside](http://www.riversidesheffield.co.uk/) later in the evening.

We’ll be booking a table, so be sure to let us know that you’re coming (for a drink, for dinner or both) so we have confirmed numbers.
