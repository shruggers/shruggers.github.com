This month, we will be working through [Johnno Nolan's](http://johnnosnose.blogspot.com/) [Chessboard Kata](https://github.com/johnnonolan/ChessBoard-Kata). The kata is being used for Johnno's MSc too, so your solutions will be contributing to academic research on BDD! You can talk to him on Twitter [here](http://twitter.com/JohnnoNolan).

There's a [Ruby version of the Chessboard Kata](https://github.com/shruggers/ChessBoard-Kata) available to clone. It's preconfigured to work easily in an [RVM environment](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/), and Cucumber and RSpec should work out of the box.

Someone will be around at the GIST Lab from no later than 6.30pm. The session will run 7pm-8.30pm, to give people time to turn up. The GIST Lab is on Grinder's Hill, at one end of the Workstation.
