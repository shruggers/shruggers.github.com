As tradition dictates, the meeting following [SRC](http://scottishrubyconference.com/) will be a retrospective of the talks or events of the conference. For those who went, would you like to pick a talk you'd like to present/recap/summarise/critique/interpret for the meeting?

For those who can't make it to Edinburgh, is there anything you'd like to hear about? Let us know. You don't have to have been to the conference to get something out of the night!

Take a look at the [conference programme](http://programme.scottishrubyconference.com/schedule) for inspiration.

Tickets for the event are available on our [EventBrite page](http://sheffieldruby1207.eventbrite.com/). Someone will be around from 18.45 if
you're around and we'll probably head out for a drink afterwards.
