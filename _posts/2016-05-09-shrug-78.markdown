Paul and Doug will begin by introducing [The Floow](http://www.thefloow.com/) and some of the more interesting components they use in their technology stack.

Then they will explain why they use Ruby at The Floow, compared to other available technologies, and what challenges this has presented.

There will be a quick tour of one of the more interesting and recent Ruby projects, [Europcar](https://www.europcar.co.uk/), and they will talk about some of the challenges faced and how they overcame them.

They will then cover what the Ruby team does on a day to day basis, and how projects are run, from source control and peer code reviews, to automatically building, testing and deploying in a load balanced environment. 

If you have any questions for them they will be welcomed at the end.
