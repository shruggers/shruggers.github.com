### Making music with Ruby and Sonic Pi

Live coding is a type of music performance and composition that most people probably don't even know exists.
The Sonic Pi editor and language aim to leverage it to teach music composition using programming (and vice versa), using a powerful Ruby DSL, which makes it very accessible to Rubyists.

This is an interactive session, where we'll go through the syntax and fundamentals of building loops, then make some music!
You'll need a Mac, Windows or Linux machine and the Sonic Pi editor, available free at <http://sonic-pi.net>.
If you have a Raspberry Pi, it should be pre-installed, but you'll need to bring your own peripherals.

Finally, you may want headphones. It might get loud.
