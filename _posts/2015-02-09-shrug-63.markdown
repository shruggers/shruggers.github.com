It's a coding trip back to the 80s as we look at using Ruby to play with Star Wars, top-trumps style! This is suitable
for complete coding beginners as well as developer Ruby newcomers. We're going to learn how to consume APIs,
organise data and run scripts from the command line.


Please come with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) and Git installed.
People will be on hand to help if you find this tricky.

'Chad' is leading this session and we invite our usual Shruggers to be on hand on the day as well as students,
developers from other languages and basically anyone who would want to learn (more) Ruby.

'Chad' Gowler is a Ruby Developer at Yoomee, coming from a Python background; Is a volunteer at a local Code Club,
spends many weekends at tech conferences (also presenting/speaking) and is interested in exploring and
challenging gender theory.

With the help of [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.org.uk/) weâ€™re at the [Enterprise Zone](http://enterprise.shef.ac.uk/about-us)
this month.

Join our [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/sheffieldrubyists/events/220110525/) to let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.15 if you're around and we'll probably head out for a drink in [The Red
Deer](http://www.red-deer-sheffield.co.uk/) afterwards.
