The fifth meeting of ShRUG is at the Electric Works. Massive thanks to the new building manager Louise for letting us use a meeting room.

The topic is [http://scottishrubyconference.com/](http://shrug.org/meetings/shrug-5/Scottish%20Ruby%20Conference). We'll be doing short talks, rapid-firing through slides from the event and talking about interesting things we saw. Then off to a pub for a quiet, thoughtful retrospective of the conference.

This month we'll be starting at 6.00pm promptly so we aren't making venue staff hang around. Please [grab a free ticket](http://shrug5.eventbrite.org/) from our EventBrite page so we can let them know who will be there.

## Where to find us

The Electric Works is a stone's throw from Sheffield Station.
