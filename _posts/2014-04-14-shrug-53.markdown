This month [Piotr Murach](https://github.com/peter-murach) will be
giving a talk on finite state machines:

A finite state machine is a computational model that underpins computer
science. Compilers use them to parse their grammars,
communication interfaces and embedded systems would not exist without
them. Would the code we write everyday benefit from the use of finite
state automata? By studying the finite_machine.rb API we will discover
the enticing world of states, transitions and see what good comes out
it.

With the help of [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.org.uk/) we’re at the [Enterprise Zone](http://enterprise.shef.ac.uk/about-us) this month.

Join our [Google+
event](https://plus.google.com/) to let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.15 if we'll head out for a drink afterwards in [The Red
Deer](http://www.red-deer-sheffield.co.uk/).
