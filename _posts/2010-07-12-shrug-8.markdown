This month is an interactive session. Ashley Moran of [PatchSpace Ltd](http://www.patchspace.co.uk/) will be running an introduction to [RSpec](http://rspec.info/), a powerful and mature BDD/testing library for Ruby. No RSpec or unit testing experience is necessary, as we will be starting from first principles, but knowing basic Ruby will help.

We're at the GIST Lab again. Someone will be around from no later than 6.30pm. The main session will run 7pm-9pm. The GIST Lab is on Grinder's Hill, at one end of the Workstation.

If you're going, please sign up for a ticket here: [http://shrug8.eventbrite.com/](http://shrug8.eventbrite.com/) (If you want to just turn up, that's fine. We just like to know who's coming to help us get ready.)
