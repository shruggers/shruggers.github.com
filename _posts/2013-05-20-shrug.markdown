This month [Colin Densem](http://www.summit360.co.uk/) will be talking on [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).


"In 1995/6 a language was emerging; Javascript, bringing with it client side executable code. 

A decade later, and after countless tales of insania, we get a glimpse that Javascript is past corporations interpreter spats. Dare we ask, are clients ready to execute code?

Almost. That was jQuery, a turning point. But we'll be taking a peek three years on, with a look at AngularJS, a Javascript Framework; some say super heroic, and I happen to like it.

We'll look at the basics, how it cleanly extends HTML, handles DOM manipulation and how to work with it beyond day one.

If time permits, some gotchas and a mountain of known unknowns, what I call the fun bits."


## Where

With the help of [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.co.uk), we're at the
[Enterprise Zone](http://enterprise.shef.ac.uk/contact-us) this month.

Join our [Google+ event]() to let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.45 if you're around and we'll probably head out to the pub afterwards.
