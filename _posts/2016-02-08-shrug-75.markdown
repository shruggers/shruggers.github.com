It's been a busy few weeks, so ShRUG is having a rest this month.

We'll be back next month, but if you fancy joining us for a drink, we'll be in the Tap and Tankard from 6.30pm to chat about all things techie (and otherwise, no doubt).

As the Tap and Tankard doesn't serve food, we may disappear for food at some point - follow us on [@sheffieldruby](https://twitter.com/sheffieldruby) for updates on the night.
