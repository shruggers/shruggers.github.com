title: Remote Pair Programming with Ruby and the Twitter streaming API
categories: meetings
time: 7pm to 9pm
location: The GIST Lab

Quentin Wright will be giving a talk on remote pair programming using
screen and Skype. The talk will explain how to remote-pair effectively
when it comes to coding and testing and describe some of the problems
encountered as well as the benefits. It will also cover some of the
particularly interesting parts of the app and the technologies we've
used.

"For the app we use the Twitter streaming API and EventMachine with
RSpec for unit and integration testing. Along the way we've flirted
with Capybara, Heroku, Resque, Redis, SCSS as well as various Twitter
gems. We're currently using a Ubuntu linux server with a PostgreSQL
database."
