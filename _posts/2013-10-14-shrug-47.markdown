October's meeting is a talk from [Glen
Mailer](http://stainlessed.co.uk/) on message queues:


A practical introduction to how and why you should be using a real
message queue - at any scale. We'll have an introduction to message
queue concepts and architecture using AMQP and RabbitMQ, exploring why
this is useful and what tasks queues are suited for. We'll then have an
opportunity for everyone to try writing queue consumers and publishers
against a sample server - no experience necessary!

Ideally attendees should arrive with Ruby 1.9.2+ pre-installed, "gem
install bunny" will also save us a bit of setup time and bandwidth.

## Where

With the help of [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.co.uk), we're at the
[Enterprise Zone](http://enterprise.shef.ac.uk/contact-us) this month.

Join our [Google+
event](https://plus.google.com/events/cf4dgmo0bh3bacrov15915rcras) to let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.15 if you're around and we'll probably head out to the pub afterwards.
