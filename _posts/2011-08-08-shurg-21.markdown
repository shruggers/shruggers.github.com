Summer's here and ShRUG's taking a holiday from the usual speakers and
activities. We're going to meet for an informal chinwag and catch-up
over a beer (or non-alcoholic alternative). It's a chance to come and get to know us if you've not been
before, or get the low down on Rails 3.1 if you have. It's also a chance
to let us know what you want to see over the next few months.

The venue is [The Sheffield Tap](http://www.sheffieldtap.com/).
Nothing's booked, but we'll try and get some tables in the back room,
through the door on the right hand side of the bar on the platform side.
If enough people are interested we can go for some food either before or
afterwards. Let us know if you are.

If you want to say hello before then you can catch us on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/sheffieldruby) or on the [Google
Group](http://groups.google.com/group/shrug-members). Or, drop us
an [email](mailto:hello@shrug.org) if you'll need help finding us
on Monday. Hope to see you there!
