Summer's over and we're back to speakers at ShRUG.

This month [Glen Mailer](http://twitter.com/#!/glenathan) will be giving
a talk on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) called "The What, Why and How of
Node.js. Glen has worked with Ruby, Python, PHP and now Node.js and
currently works for [Sky Bet](http://www.skybet.com/) in Leeds.

>Node's goal is to provide an easy way to build scalable network programs ... \[and\] is similar in design to and influenced by systems like Ruby's Event Machine or Python's Twisted. HTTP is a first class protocol in Node. Node's HTTP library has grown out of the author's experiences developing and working with web servers. For example, streaming data through most web frameworks is impossible. Node attempts to correct these problems in its HTTP parser and API. Coupled with Node's purely evented infrastructure, it makes a good foundation for web libraries or frameworks.


The talk will be followed by a programming task if time permits.


The venue is [The GIST lab](http://thegisthub.net/). There will be
someone there from around 18.30. We'll head out for a drink afterwards
too.
