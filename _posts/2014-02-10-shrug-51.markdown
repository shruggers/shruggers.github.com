This month will be a relaxed social event at [The Red
Deer](http://www.red-deer-sheffield.co.uk/) (the usual post-meeting
venue). Chat about Ruby/Rails, have something to eat, have a good catch-up or come along and say
hello if you're new to the group or want to know more about Ruby/Rails. Let us know if you're coming and you don't know who you're looking for!

Join our [Google+
event](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cu6jsao79ack1i7o24mj0et2tu8) to
let us know you're coming.
