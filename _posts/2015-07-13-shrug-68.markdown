### OpenSteetMap (OSM) and geospatial Ruby

Wanted to know more about the open-source movement that is creeping up on Google Maps and Apple Maps? How about learning about it from Tim who has been in [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) for around ten years.

He is a full member of both OpenStreetMap and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Foundations. In this talk he will introduce the OSM project and website (written in Ruby on Rails) and talk about some other useful Ruby geospatial libraries and applications including MapWarper.net

### Bonus round - The surgery: BYO Ruby problem

We are trialling out a new end of a session format where you can bring a problem to the table, and the community will try to help you out with it. If you don't have a problem, that's OK - bring your own ideas to help solve other people's problems.
