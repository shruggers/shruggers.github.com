### OpenSteetMap(OSM) and Geospacial Ruby

Wanted to know more about the open-source movement that is creeping up to Goolgle Maps and Apple Maps? How about learning about it from Tim who has been in [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/)(OSM) for around ten years. 

He is a full member of both OpenStreetMap and Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Foundations. In this talk he will introduce the OSM project and website (written in Ruby on Rails) and talk about some other useful Ruby geospatial libraries and applications including MapWarper.net

### Bonus round - The surgery: BYO Ruby problem

We are trialing out this new end of a session format where if you bring a problem to the table, the community will try to help you out with it. If you don't have a problem, that's ok - bring your own ideas to solve other people's problems.
