title: ShRUG 1st Birthday Meal
---

This month's ShRUG is the group's 1st birthday. ShRUG was originally conceived on a train back from NWRUG over a year ago, and started not long after with a meeting in the Bath Hotel. We moved around a bit before settling on the GIST Lab as our regular venue.

Our first birthday meal will be at the Saffron Club in Sheffield Centre, near the meeting of West St and Glossop Road (not far from the Uni tram stop). There is already a table provisionally booked, but we need to know exact numbers so please sign up for a [ticket](http://shrug13.eventbrite.com/).
