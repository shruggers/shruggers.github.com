This month will be a relaxed social event at [The Red
Deer](http://www.red-deer-sheffield.co.uk/) (the usual post-meeting
venue). Chat about Ruby/Rails, have something to eat, have a good catch-up or come along and say
hello if you're new to the group. Let us know if you're coming and you
don't know who you're looking for!
