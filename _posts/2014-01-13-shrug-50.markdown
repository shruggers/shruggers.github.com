This month we're holding another round of our Ruby code battle but this time with a different challenge. Write your player and pit them against the other entrants. Pair up with someone else or work alone, the choice is yours! We'll reveal the problem on the night (and provide a base framework to write your player against) so you can't go researching strategies beforehand. In a similar way to a kata or dojo, hopefully this will be a good opportunity to test your Ruby skills in a way that you wouldn't on a day-to-day basis.

This will be a practical session so don't forget to bring a laptop with Ruby installed, wireless and access to a GitHub (or equivalent) account.

With the help of [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.co.uk), we're at the
[Enterprise Zone](http://enterprise.shef.ac.uk/contact-us) this month.

Join our [Google+
event](https://plus.google.com/events/cc6iip2ojj2s6lijda16m9cpnq8) to
let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.15 if you're around and we'll probably head out for a drink in [The Red
Deer](http://www.red-deer-sheffield.co.uk/) afterwards.
