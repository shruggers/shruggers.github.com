This month Ash Moran will be running a talk & workshop called Parsing
for Fun & Profit. This is a new and improved version of the [NWRUG talk from February this year](http://nwrug.org/events/february-2013-parsing-for-fun-profit/).

Practical workshop! After an intro to parsing, we'll break off into
groups and have a go at writing a parser for JSON using
[Treetop](http://treetop.rubyforge.org/).

## What’s the Deal?

Parsing is understanding computer languages and data formats. You don't
need a computer science background to write a parser, and they aren’t
just useful for building complex tools like compilers and interpreters.
Here are some simpler applications you might have seen:

* syntax highlighting
* calculating metrics (e.g. code complexity)
* minifying code (popular with JavaScript)

## What will we see and do?

* A quick intro to parsing
* A quick intro to Treetop
* A demo of how to incrementally build up a simple parser
* WORKSHOP! We'll work on a JSON parser
* A tour of a simple syntax highlighter for Ruby written in Treetop

## What will you need?

If you can, please bring a laptop running Ruby 1.9.3 or 2.0.0, and Git.
Don't worry if you can't, we'll work in pairs or small teams on the
night.

Experience of regular expressions will be a big help, but we'll try to
match people based on their regex-fu. Treetop grammars are a bit more
complex than regular expressions, but not much.

## About the Speaker

Ash Moran is a freelance software developer & agile coach based in
Manchester, and owner of [PatchSpace Ltd](http://patchspace.co.uk/). He has been using Ruby for many
years, and has yet to find another language that makes writing high
quality software so much fun.


## Where

With the help of [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.co.uk), we're at the
[Enterprise Zone](http://enterprise.shef.ac.uk/contact-us) this month.

Join our [Google+ event](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/cii7479u0oauhvu1verm622h2tc) to let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.45 if you're around and we'll probably head out for a drink afterwards.
