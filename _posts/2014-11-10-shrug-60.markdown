This month is a break from the usual talk schedule to get involved with
the wider Sheffield tech scene and give some input on how future
developers will learn. We're encouraging Sheffield's Rubyists to attend
[a series of
workshops](http://learning.mundojumbo.net/2014/designing-a-learning-experience-for-applied-computing/) on defining a curriculum for the city's new
University Technical College:

> Sheffield’s second University Technical College (UTC) has been given
> the green light. It will specialise in Applied Computing and Human
> Sciences, opening its doors to 14-19 year olds in September 2016.

> Over the next few weeks we’ll be hosting a series of public workshops
> in Sheffield to help us define a flexible and progressive curriculum
> framework and learning experience that is industry-driven.  We’ll test
> how your recommendations and suggestions might fit together, and drill
> into the detail of real business priorities that will shape the
> curriculum development recommendations.
