### Time for some sun, drinks, food and chat!

##### *(That's the plan anyway!)*

Summer is on the way (hopefully!) so it's time for our summer social.

Come and join us in the Rutland Arms for a few drinks, some food, a good chat about all things Ruby, Rails, tech, etc., and hopefully some nice weather so we can enjoy the beer garden!
