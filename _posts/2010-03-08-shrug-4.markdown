The fourth meeting of ShRUG is again taking place in Mojo. It's becoming a habit...

More discussion of Rails 3 is likely. But what else? Who knows...

We'll be arriving at 6.30pm to start talking Ruby (and related stuff) at 7pm. Start time is partly dependent on when Ian arrives with his magic pen :)

## Where to find us

Mojo is near Waitrose, off London Road. It's at the old Dulo venue.
