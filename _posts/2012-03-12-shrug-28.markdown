This month we will be running a [Coding Dojo](http://codingdojo.org/) at ShRUG.

"A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge. They are there have fun and to engage in Deliberate Practice in order to improve their skills."


We'll be running a Randori-style session with a driver and co-pilot, swapping out every 5 minues, and developing a solution to the problem using [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).

The session is open to all skill levels and is great chance to get to
grips with testing, try out some new ideas, hone your skills with others
and, most importantly, have some fun in the process. We'll be using Ruby and
RSpec to develop the solution.

The venue is [The GIST lab](http://thegisthub.net/). There will be
someone there from around 18.45. We'll head out for a drink afterwards
too.

Tickets are available on our [EventBrite page](bit.ly/shrug1203).

If you want to say hello before then you can catch us on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/ShRUGbot) or on the [Google
Group](http://groups.google.com/group/shrug-members). Or, drop us
an [email](mailto:shrug@jamesalmond.com) if you'll need help finding us
on Monday. Hope to see you there!
