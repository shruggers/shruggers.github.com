This month we'll be focussing on community events. Sheffield (and
ShRUG!) was represented really well at [Hack
Manchester](http://www.hackmanchester.com/). The ShRUG attendees will be
presenting their hacks and giving us some feedback about the event.


Also, as there isn't currently an event organised in Sheffield for the
[Global Day of Code Retreat](http://globalday.coderetreat.org/), we'll
be putting on a mini Code Retreat (or code-retreat-style event for those
who are sticklers for the rules) which will be facilitated by Eva. Bring
a laptop if you can. We'll pair people off, do if you're new to Ruby
then this could be a good opporutnity to brush up on your skills.

## Where

With the help of [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.co.uk), we're at the
[Enterprise Zone](http://enterprise.shef.ac.uk/contact-us) this month.

Join our [Google+
event](https://plus.google.com/events/ccii29ber0epol56gkadtm1v9rg) to let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.15 if you're around and we'll probably head out to the pub afterwards.
