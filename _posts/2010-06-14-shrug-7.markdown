ShRUG has its first presentation! Thanks to [Jan Wedekind](http://www.wedesoft.demon.co.uk/) of [Sheffield Hallam University](http://www.shu.ac.uk/research/meri/mmvl/) for doing a presentation on his [HornetsEye Library](http://www.wedesoft.demon.co.uk/hornetseye-api/files/HornetsEye-txt.html). Also, this is the first ShRUG to be held in the new GIST Lab.

The topic is how to make implementing machine vision and object recognition algorithms much easier using the Ruby programming language. Machine vision requires real-time video I/O and low-level image manipulation. The work being presented has been partially funded by the EPSRC Nanorobotics research grant.

Someone will be around at the GIST Lab from no later than 6.30pm. The presentation and questions will run 7pm-9pm. The GIST Lab is on Grinder's Hill, at one end of the Workstation.
