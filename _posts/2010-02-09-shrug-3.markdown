title: Late Winter ShRUG
---

The third meeting of ShRUG is yet another informal pub meeting. We're re-using last month's venue, Mojo. Hopefully this time we'll find out if there's any chance of them getting a proper room sorted.

Topics that will no doubt come up include the Rails 3 beta and Heroku's Ruby 1.8.7 / 1.9.1 beta. Because the organiser will make sure they do :-)

We'll be arriving at 6.30pm to start talking Ruby (and related stuff) at 7pm.

## Where to find us

Mojo is near Waitrose, off London Road. It's at the old Dulo venue.
