This month’s ShRUG talk is from [James Almond](http://jamesalmond.com/)
on what's in, what's out and what you need to know about Rails 4 and Ruby 2.0.

With the [end of the GIST foundation](http://thegistfoundation.org/)
we're changing venues to the
[Workstation](http://www.showroomworkstation.org.uk/workstation/) Conference Room 2. Entry
through the Workstation reception (not the Showroom).

Sign up to our [Lanyrd Page](http://lanyrd.com/2013/sheffieldruby/) or
join our [Google+
event](https://plus.google.com/events/cnei77hh8ch5og2p25map7htihk) to
let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.45 if you're around and we'll probably head out for a drink afterwards.
