ShRUG is going Scottish with a look at Scottish Ruby Conference. Like last year, we'll be doing short talks, rapid-firing through slides from the event and talking about interesting things we saw. Then off to a pub for a quiet, thoughtful retrospective of the conference (possibly over a whisky).

Sword-fighting is expressly forbidden as the GIST Lab health and safety policy forbids it. However, if you bring your own office chair you can [take it outside](http://xkcd.com/303/).

Someone will be around at the GIST Lab from no later than 6.30pm. The session will run 7pm-8.30pm, to give people time to turn up. The GIST Lab is on Grinder's Hill, at one end of the Workstation.

The ticket page is not up yet, but if you check here later there might be one: [http://shrug17.eventbrite.com/](http://shrug17.eventbrite.com/)
