This month [Tom Crayford](http://www.tcrayford.net/) will be running a session on continuous delivery:

"As ruby developers, we (mostly) aspire to early and continuous delivery of valuable software. This hands-on workshop will test how well you can meet that goal by challenging you to code a simple bot that will have to compete in a series of battles.

You can continue to refine and upgrade your bot though the tournament. The earlier you release your bot, the sooner you will win some battles and start accruing points."

So don't forget to bring laptops! We're intentionally keeping quiet
about the nature of the task to ensure everyone's on the same level.

The venue is [The GIST lab](http://thegisthub.net/). There will be
someone there from around 18.30. We'll head out for a drink afterwards
too.

Tickets will be available on our [EventBrite page](http://bit.ly/shrug1111).

You can also note your attendance on [Lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/2011/shrug-24) if you're that way inclined.

If you want to say hello before then you can catch us on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/sheffieldruby) or on the [Google
Group](http://groups.google.com/group/shrug-members). Or, drop us
an [email](mailto:hello@shrug.org) if you'll need help finding us
on Monday. Hope to see you there!
