This month [Ash Moran](http://www.patchspace.co.uk/) will be running a session on speeding up tests with Rails:

"Developing high quality software rapidly requires a fast TDD loop. Ash will talk about the obstacles Rails presents and offer some advice."

The venue is [The GIST lab](http://thegisthub.net/). There will be
someone there from around 18.45. We'll head out for a drink afterwards
too.

Tickets will are available on our [EventBrite page](http://bit.ly/shrug1201).

If you want to say hello before then you can catch us on
[Twitter](http://twitter.com/ShRUGbot) or on the [Google
Group](http://groups.google.com/group/shrug-members). Or, drop us
an [email](mailto:shrug@jamesalmond.com) if you'll need help finding us
on Monday. Hope to see you there!
