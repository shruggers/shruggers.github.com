This month’s ShRUG talk is by [Brightbox's](http://www.brightbox.co.uk/) [John Leach](http://johnleach.co.uk/):

"A lot of importance is placed on good GUI design but it’s easy to overlook good command line interfaces.

Taking from our experiences writing the Brightbox Cloud cli (and years of using cli tools, both good and bad), this talk will show you some of things you need to consider when designing a good cli interface (with a focus on Ruby!).

And all this without turning to ncurses!"

Tickets are be available on our [EventBrite page](http://bit.ly/shfruby1209), please sign up if you're coming. We've also got a [Lanyrd page](http://lanyrd.com/2012/shrug-34/), if that's your thing.

Someone will be around from 18.45 if you're around and we'll probably head out for a drink afterwards.
