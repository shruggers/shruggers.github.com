This month's talk is from Luke Roberts and is a comparison between Go and Ruby. From the abstract:

"We all *love* Ruby.
Most people don’t get to get paid for doing what they find fun.
Ruby is a big part of what has made programming fun over the last few years.
That said we are all hackers and like to play with new toys. We relish the opportunity to use something new but its hard to find a task we can’t simply do a better job of in Ruby.
Well, recently I had a task where Ruby was not even an option. We chose Go. And this is what we learned!"

The talk will cover the some fundamentals, such as compiled vs. dynamic, bundler vs. godep,
class based OO vs. struct base *OO*, pass by reference vs. pass by value, GIL vs. Concurrency and much more.

Luke is a fellow allstar in helping build [Sqwiggle](http://www.sqwiggle.com/) adding skills on top of quite a lot of Ruby experience in the past
at [The Floow](http://www.thefloow.com/) and [Llama Digital](http://www.llamadigital.co.uk/).

With the help of [epiGenesys](http://www.epigenesys.org.uk/) we’re at the [Enterprise Zone](http://enterprise.shef.ac.uk/about-us) this month.

Join our [Google+
event](https://plus.google.com/u/0/events/c1cl9pu3gtvb08pjjju3sgkhrno) to let us know you're coming.

Someone will be around from 18.15 if you're around and we'll probably head out for a drink in [The Red
Deer](http://www.red-deer-sheffield.co.uk/) afterwards.
