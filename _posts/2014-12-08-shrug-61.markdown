It's that time of the year again. Time to put the talks and workshops to
one side for a month and get together for Sheffield Ruby's annual Christmas meal.

This year we're going to [Anchorage Bar](http://www.anchoragebar.co.uk/) for 7pm for food and drinks.

We'll be booking a table, so be sure to let us know that you're coming
so we have confirmed numbers by responding on the [Meetup
page](http://www.meetup.com/sheffieldrubyists/events/218897387/) or
[dropping us an email](mailto:hello@shrug.org) or [Tweet
