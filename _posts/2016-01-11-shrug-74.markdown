### Lightning talks - New Year Version

Happy New Year, #shruggers. We haven't had a session of Lightning talks in a while and we are keen to know what awesome new things you are into. So why not let us know by following a 20 slides x 20 seconds each, format. It can be Ruby related, or not. There is no requirement to give a talk, but if you are interested in speaking, we can offer a safe environment.

#### About our speakers

We managed to recruit some of our #shruggers at the Christmas Meal, but please let us know (possibly even gauge some interest on our [#sheffieldruby Slack channel](https://sheffielddigital.slack.com/messages/sheffieldruby)) if you want to give a talk as we still have some slots available.

#### About our venue

Our meetup tonight will take place at our still newish venue, [Union St](http://www.union-st.org).

After tonight's meetup, we'll be heading to the [Rutland Arms](http://www.therutlandarmssheffield.co.uk/) for drinks, food and chat.
