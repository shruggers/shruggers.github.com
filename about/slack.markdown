### What on earth is Slack?

Courtesy of [Sheffield.Digital](http://sheffield.digital/), we now have a dedicated Slack channel for our members to discuss all things Ruby
and for the organisers to keep you up to date with related events happening in the Sheffield Ruby community.

<div class="slack-button">
  <a href="https://sheffielddigital.slack.com/messages/sheffieldruby" class="button">
    <span class="fa fa-slack"></span> Join the conversation on Slack
  </a>
</div>

#### How do I join in?

Unfortunately, Slack is invite only, so you will need to get in touch with Sheffield.Digital to request access.

Please see their announcement over at [http://sheffield.digital/announcing-the-sheffielddigital-slack-team/](http://sheffield.digital/announcing-the-sheffielddigital-slack-team/)
and contact Mel to request an invite.
