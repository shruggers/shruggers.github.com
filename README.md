# @sheffieldruby

Presentation site for Sheffield Ruby

## Deployment

We use githubpages to deploy a Jekyll blog. Since 01/02/2016 future post no longer appear as github has updated to jekyll 3.0

We followed https://drewsilcock.co.uk/custom-jekyll-plugins/ to include the --future flag for the serve command and now the site will not be autogenerated by github.

Workflow on adding events:

```
git co source
```

Add event in post then run:

```
jekgit.sh "Added event X"
```

that will generate and push to the master site
