# @sheffieldruby

Presentation site for Sheffield Ruby User Group

## Deployment

We use github-pages to deploy a Jekyll blog. Since 01/02/2016 future post no longer appear as github has updated to jekyll 3.0

We followed https://drewsilcock.co.uk/custom-jekyll-plugins/ to include the --future flag for the serve command and now the site will not be autogenerated by github.

###Workflow on adding events

Checkout the source branch

```
git checkout source
```

Add event in posts then run:

```
./jekgit.sh "Build with event X"
```

that will generate and push to the master site to github. Check the event and if all looks well then commit the event onto source

```
git commit -am "Added event X"
```
and you are all good to go :)
